We use a Scanner to read input from the user.
We create a BufferedWriter to write to the todo.txt file.
The user is prompted to enter to-do items one by one. They can enter "done" to finish entering items.
Each to-do item is written to the file, one per line.
Finally, a message is printed to confirm that the to-do items have been saved to the file..
